## Introduction
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for global IP address allocation among the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The five RIRs manage the resources they have been allocated by IANA and further allocate resources to organizations in specific regions of the world. They distribute IP address blocks to National Internet Registries (NIRs), Local Internet Registries (LIRs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or end-user organizations. 

Each entity delegates IP address block to a customer organization under certain terms of agreement which dictate its usage. The RIRs use `status` or `NetType` fields to indicate the delegation status and usage terms of the IP address block. RIRs use different values for these fields and in this blog, we decode the keywords used and the delegation hierarchy of each RIR.

## Data
In this study we use the bulk WHOIS data from five RIRs. WHOIS data from RIRs contains information about IP address blocks, delegation status, organization who has been delegated the address space, Autonomous System Numbers, domain names, and contact details of network administrators. This data is publicly available and can be accessed through the WHOIS protocol <d-cite key="rfc3912"></d-cite>.

WHOIS data consists of several types of records such as `inetnum`, `inet6num`, `aut-num`, `domain`, `organisation`, `person`, `route` and `route6`. Each record serves data for a different purpose. For example, the `inetnum` record contains information about an IP address block, the `aut-num` record contains information about an Autonomous System Number, and the `organisation` record contains information about an organization registered with an RIR. In this study, we focus on the `inetnum` and `inet6num` records which contain information about IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks respectively. Note that `route` and `route6` records contain information about the routing policies of an organization and are not used in this study.

## Delegation statuses
Check the [Appendix](#appendix) for a sample WHOIS data from each RIR.

### ARIN
ARIN uses the `NetType` field to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. The `NetType` field can have the values - _ALLOCATION_, _ASSIGNMENT_, _REALLOCATION_, _REASSIGNMENT_, _RIR_ and _RESERVED_. The values indicate the following:
- **ALLOCATION** : IP address block has been directly allocated by ARIN to an LIR or ISP.
- **REALLOCATION** : IP address block has been reallocated by the LIR or ISP to a downstream customer.
- **ASSIGNMENT** : IP address block has been reserved by IANA for special purposes<d-footnote>These address blocks are more commonly known as bogon prefixes. The complete list can be found <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml">here</a>.</d-footnote>.
- **REASSIGNMENT** : IP address block has been reassigned to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated.
- **RIR** : IP address block has been delegated to either self or other RIRs by ARIN.
- **RESERVED** : IP address block has been reserved by IANA.

| ARIN          | inetnum   | inet6num   |
|:--------------|----------:|-----------:|
| ALLOCATION    | 2.3%      | 3.23%      |
| ASSIGNMENT    | 0.0%      | 0.0%       |
| REASSIGNMENT  | 96.04%    | 93.28%     |
| RIR           | 0.24%     | 0.01%      |
| REALLOCATION  | 1.43%     | 3.47%      |
| RESERVED      | 0.0%      | 0.0%       |
| **Total records** | **3,158,560** | **299,535**    |

### LACNIC
LACNIC indicates the delegation type in the `status` field of its WHOIS data. The `status` field can have the values - _ALLOCATED_, _REALLOCATED_, _ASSIGNED_ and _REASSIGNED_. Similar to the keywords used by ARIN, the status values indicate the following:

- **ALLOCATED** : IP address block has been directly allocated by LACNIC to an LIR or ISP.
- **REALLOCATED** : IP address block has been reallocated by the LIR or ISP to a downstream customer.
- **ASSIGNED** : <font color="red">Verify this!</font> IP address block has been assigned to an end-user organization.
- **REASSIGNED** : IP address block has been reassigned to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated.

| LACNIC        | inetnum   | inet6num   |
|:--------------|----------:|-----------:|
| ASSIGNED      | 0.55%     | 5.57%      |
| ALLOCATED     | 3.61%     | 40.0%      |
| REALLOCATED   | 71.86%    | 41.01%     |
| REASSIGNED    | 23.99%    | 13.42%     |
| **Total records** | **466,256**   | **28,022**     |

{: .table-caption}


### AFRINIC and RIPE

AFRINIC and RIPE use the same set of keywords to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. They use the `status` field to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. The `status` field can have values such as _ALLOCATED PA_, _ASSIGNED PI_, _ASSIGNED PA_ and _SUB-ALLOCATED PA_. 

#### Terminologies
- **Provider Aggregatable (PA)** : These address blocks are allocated to LIRs and are designed to be aggregated while making route announcements on BGP. LIRs can sub-allocate or assign smaller blocks to their customers and are responsible for maintaining the registration information with the RIRs. Since these IP ranges are tied to the LIR, the customers have to relinquish these address blocks when changing providers<d-cite key="ripe_pa_vs_pi"></d-cite>.

- **Provider Independent (PI)** : These address blocks are assigned to an end-user organization directly by an RIR and allow the holder to maintain the allocation independent of the upstream provider. While these allocations offer more flexibility to the end-user, it increases the load on the global routing table since the address blocks have to be announced individually on BGP and cannot be aggregated with the PA address blocks. These address blocks are increasingly rare due to the depletion of IPv4 addresses and the need for routing aggregation. RIPE has stopped issuing IPv4 PI address blocks but can still issue IPv6 PI address blocks.

- **Sub-allocation** - Sub-allocations allow an LIR to distribute smaller blocks of its _ALLOCATED PA_ address space to downstream entities who can make further assignments to end-users. LIRs holding _ALLOCATED PI_ or _ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED_ allocations may be able to convert them to PA allocations if there are no _ASSIGNED PI_ networks within it. The LIRs are responsible for maintaining the registration information with the RIRs. They are also recommended to ensure that the downstream customers return the assigned address space when chaging their service providers<d-cite key="ripe_whois_status_doc"></d-cite>.

#### Description

The most common field values used by AFRNIC and RIPE indicate the following <d-footnote>The complete documentation by RIPE can be found <a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-826/#70-types-of-address-space">here</a>.</d-footnote>:
- **ALLOCATED PA** : IP address block has been directly allocated by the RIR to an LIR or ISP. It can be further sub-allocated or assigned to downstream customers, but the downstream entity must return the address space when changing providers.
- **ASSIGNED PI** : IP address block has been assigned by the RIR to an end-user organization. The end-user can change upstream providers without renumbering the address space.
- **SUB-ALLOCATED PA** : IP address block has been sub-allocated by an LIR or ISP to a downstream customer. The downstream customer can further assign address blocks to its own customers. The address block must be returned to the LIR or ISP when changing providers.
- **ASSIGNED PA** : IP address block has been assigned by an LIR or network provider to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated.
- **LEGACY** : IP address block was assigned to an organization prior to the formation of the RIRs. These address blocks are not subject to the same policies as the other address blocks and are not managed by the RIRs.
- **LIR-PARTITIONED PA** : LIRs manage this block within their organization. This address block is considered not used and more specific address blocks should be registered.

Some of the values found only in `inet6num` i.e. IPv6 address blocks are <d-cite key="ripe_ipv6_doc_1"></d-cite>:
- **ALLOCATED-BY-RIR** : IP address block has been directly allocated by the RIR to an LIR or ISP.
- **ALLOCATED-BY-LIR** : This status value is equivalent to the _SUB-ALLOCATED PA_ attribute IP address block has been allocated by an LIR to sub-ordinate ISPs.
- **AGGREGATED-BY-LIR** : IP address block has been aggregated by an LIR from smaller assignments to multiple customers. The smaller assignments must be of the same size and the size is mentioned in the `assignment-size` attribute of the record<d-cite key="ripe_ipv6_doc_1"></d-cite><d-cite key="ripe_ipv6_doc_2"></d-cite>.
- **ASSIGNED** : IP address block has been assigned by an LIR to self or an end-user organization.

### APNIC
APNIC uses the `status` field to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. The `status` field can have the values - _ALLOCATED PORTABLE_, _ALLOCATED NON-PORTABLE_, _ASSIGNED PORTABLE_ and _ASSIGNED NON-PORTABLE_. The values indicate the following <d-cite key="apnic_whois_status_doc"></d-key> :

- **ALLOCATED PORTABLE** : IP address block has been directly allocated by APNIC to an LIR or ISP and can be further sub-allocated or assigned to downstream customers.
- **ALLOCATED NON-PORTABLE** : IP address block has been directly allocated by an LIR or ISP to their customers. The address block has to be returned to the provider when changing the upstream provider.
- **ASSIGNED PORTABLE** : IP address block has been assigned by APNIC to small-multihoming organizations or IXPs. These assignments can be retained by the customer while changing the network provider.
- **ASSIGNED NON-PORTABLE** : IP address block has been assigned by an LIR or ISP to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated. The address block has to be returned to the provider when changing the upstream provider.

| APNIC                  | inetnum   | inet6num   |
