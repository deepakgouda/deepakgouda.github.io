## Introduction
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for global IP address allocation among the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The five RIRs manage the resources they have been allocated by IANA and further allocate resources to organizations in specific regions of the world. They distribute IP address blocks to National Internet Registries (NIRs), Local Internet Registries (LIRs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or end-user organizations. We can think of the delegation of IP address blocks as a tree structure where the root is IANA and the leaves are the end-user organizations. 

Each entity delegates IP address block to a customer organization under certain terms of agreement which dictate the control and usage of the delegated space. The RIRs use `status` or `NetType` fields to indicate the delegation and usage terms of the IP address block. RIRs use different values for these fields and in this blog, we study the characteristics and meaning behind each value.

## Data
In this study we use the bulk WHOIS data from five RIRs. Each RIR is responsible for managing IP address allocations and registrations in a specific region of the world. WHOIS data from RIRs contains information about IP address blocks, delegation status, organization who has been delegated the address space, Autonomous System Numbers, domain names, and contact details of network administrators. This data is publicly available and can be accessed through the WHOIS protocol <d-cite key="rfc3912"></d-cite>.

WHOIS data consists of several types of records such as `inetnum`, `inet6num`, `aut-num`, `domain`, `organisation`, `person`, `route` and `route6`. Each record serves data for a different purpose. For example, the `inetnum` record contains information about an IP address block, the `aut-num` record contains information about an Autonomous System Number, and the `organisation` record contains information about an organization registered with an RIR. In this study, we focus on the `inetnum` and `inet6num` records which contain information about IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks and their delegation status. Note that `route` and `route6` records contain information about the routing policies of an organization and are not used in this study.

## WHOIS Data
Check the [Appendix](#appendix) for a sample WHOIS data from each RIR.

### ARIN
ARIN uses the `NetType` field to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. The `NetType` field can have values such as `ALLOCATION`, `ASSIGNMENT`, `REALLOCATION`, `REASSIGNMENT`, `RIR` and `RESERVED`. The field values indicate the following:
- **ALLOCATION** : IP address block has been directly allocated by ARIN to an LIR or ISP.
- **REALLOCATION** : IP address block has been reallocated by the LIR or ISP to a downstream customer.
- **ASSIGNMENT** : IP address block has been reserved by IANA for special purposes<d-footnote>These address blocks are more commonly known as bogon prefixes. The complete list can be found <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml">here</a>.</d-footnote>.
- **REASSIGNMENT** : IP address block has been reassigned to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated.
- **RIR** : IP address block has been delegated to either self or other RIRs by ARIN.
- **RESERVED** : IP address block has been reserved by IANA.

| ALLOCATION    | 2.3%      | 3.23%      |

### LACNIC
LACNIC indicates the delegation type in the `status` field of its WHOIS data. The `status` field can have values such as `ALLOCATED`, `REALLOCATED`, `ASSIGNED` and `REASSIGNED`. Similar to the keywords used by ARIN, the status values indicate the following:

- **ALLOCATED** : IP address block has been directly allocated by LACNIC to an LIR or ISP.
- **REALLOCATED** : IP address block has been reallocated by the LIR or ISP to a downstream customer.
- **ASSIGNED** : **_Check here_** IP address block has been assigned to an end-user organization.
- **REASSIGNED** : IP address block has been reassigned to an end-user organization and cannot be further delegated.

|               | inetnum   | inet6num   |
|:--------------|:----------|:-----------|
| ASSIGNED      | 0.55%     | 5.57%      |
| ALLOCATED     | 3.61%     | 40.0%      |
| REALLOCATED   | 71.86%    | 41.01%     |
| REASSIGNED    | 23.99%    | 13.42%     |
| **Total records** | **466,256**   | **28,022**     |

### AFRINIC and RIPE

AFRINIC and RIPE use the same set of keywords to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. They use the `status` field to indicate the delegation status of an IP address block. The `status` field can have values such as `ALLOCATED PA`, `ASSIGNED PI`, `ASSIGNED PA` and `SUB-ALLOCATED PA`. The field values indicate the following <d-footnote>The official documentation by RIPE can be found <a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-826/#70-types-of-address-space">here</a>.</d-footnote>:
