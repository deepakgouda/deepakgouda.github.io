  abstract={Blockchain technology is finding its application in a wide range of areas. Due to the highly decentralized and distributed nature of blockchain technology, it is essential to understand the behaviour of a system before its actual deployment. In this paper, we introduce the design and architecture of our blockchain simulator, BlockEval, which mimics the behaviour of concurrent operations that occur in a real-life blockchain system. We have established the correctness of our simulator by comparing it with an independent model that is built from the real Bitcoin-transactions data using deep-learning techniques. Unlike existing validation procedures which do not scale to large topologies, our method is scalable and efficient in terms of time and compute-infrastructure requirements. The observations made using our simulator are found to match with the results obtained from the model trained on real Bitcoin-transactions data.},

  abstract={In this paper, we show an innovative way to construct bootstrap confidence interval of a signal estimated based on a univariate LSTM model. We take three different types of bootstrap methods for dependent set up. We prescribe some useful suggestions to select the optimal block length while performing the bootstrapping of the sample. We also propose a benchmark to compare the confidence interval measured through different bootstrap strategies. We illustrate the experimental results through some stock price data set.},

  journal={arXiv pre-print},
  year={2023},
  month={Jun},
  day={11},
  abstract={The optimal learning rate for adaptive gradient methods applied to {\lambda}-strongly convex functions relies on the parameters {\lambda} and learning rate {\eta}. In this paper, we adapt a universal algorithm along the lines of Metagrad, to get rid of this dependence on {\lambda} and {\eta}. The main idea is to concurrently run multiple experts and combine their predictions to a master algorithm. This master enjoys O(d log T) regret bounds.},

  abstract = {We present a new on-device pipeline that efficiently summarizes lecture videos and provides relevant answers directly from a smartphone. We utilize widely accessible tools like OCR and Vosk speech-to-text, coupled with powerful large language models (LLMs), to identify crucial sentences and generate summaries. By harnessing the capabilities of LLMs and the computational power of mobile devices, we fine-tune and quantize BERT and GPT-2 to achieve efficient lecture video summarization and question answering on consumer-grade smartphones like the Pixel 8 Pro. Notably, this approach eliminates the need for cloud APIs, ensuring enhanced user privacy and minimal mobile data usage.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zwGdONlKays},
