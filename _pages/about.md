My research focuses on comprehensively understanding and improving the Internet With a strong emphasis on enhancing Internet safety, I aim to develop novel approaches to mitigate vulnerabilities and contribute to a more secure and accessible online environment.

I am advised by [Dr. Cecilia Testart](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/cecilia-testart) and [Dr. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/). I also collaborate with researchers from [Internet Initiative of Japan](https://www.iijlab.net).

I have worked as a quantitative researcher in algo-trading domain where I worked on statistical modelling of financial
data and developed low latency trading systems.

As a part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I developed a Blockchain Simulator and proposed a model to validate any
simulation framework. I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Kalpesh Kapoor](https://www.iitg.ac.in/kalpesh/).

I graduated with a major in *Mathematics and Computing* from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2020.

On weekends you can find me exploring history, technology or photography. I often explore mountains or spend a night capturing the night sky. Feel free to browse my creative work
