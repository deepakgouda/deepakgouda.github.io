I am an upcoming Master's student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in applying machine learning techinques
to model and predict metrics over large-scale graphs, especially computer networks.

I worked as a quantitative researcher in algo-trading domain where I worked on statistical modelling of financial
data. I also developed several low trading latency systems on C++.

As a part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I developed a Blockchain Simulator and proposed a model to validate any
simulation framework. I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Kalpesh Kapoor](https://www.iitg.ac.in/kalpesh/).
More details [here](https://deepakgouda.github.io/publications/).

I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology degree, majoring in *Mathematics and Computing* from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2020.

On the weekends you can find me exploring history, technology, fiction or photography. Occasionally you can
find me exploring remote mountains or spending nights capturing the Milky Way. Feel free to browse my creative work
