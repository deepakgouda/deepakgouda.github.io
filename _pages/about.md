I am an Master's student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning. I am interested in applying machine learning techniques to study internet data and make it a more secure, robust place. Currently, I work under the guidance of [Dr. Cecilia Testart](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ctestart/).

I have worked as a quantitative researcher in algo-trading domain where I worked on statistical modelling of financial
data and developed low trading latency systems.

As a part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I developed a Blockchain Simulator and proposed a model to validate any
simulation framework. I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Kalpesh Kapoor](https://www.iitg.ac.in/kalpesh/).

I graduated with a major in *Mathematics and Computing* from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2020.

On weekends you can find me exploring history, technology or photography. You can also
find me exploring mountains or spending nights capturing the night sky. Feel free to browse my creative work
at the [Gallery](/shots).
