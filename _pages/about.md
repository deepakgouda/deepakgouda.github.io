I am a quantitative strategist working at the algorithmic trading firm [Kivi Capital](http://kivicapital.in).
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical modeling techniques and data networks such as
*stochastic networks* and analysis of information in such data rich environments.

I primarily work on statistical modelling of financial time series data in *Forex* and *Commodity* segments.
I have also developed low latency trading systems and worked on the entire life cycle of algorithmic trading,
from data capture over high speed networks to formulation and execution of trade signals.

I did my Bachelor thesis under the guidance of [Dr. Kalpesh Kapoor](https://www.iitg.ac.in/kalpesh/) where we
developed a lightweight, modular framework to generate network-level synthetic data of any Blockchain topology.
We further proposed a novel validation method for any Blockchain framework.

I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology degree, majoring in *Mathematics and Computing* from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2020.
