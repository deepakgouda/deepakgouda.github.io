My research focuses on comprehensively understanding and improving the Internet. With a strong emphasis on enhancing Internet safety, I aim to develop novel approaches to mitigate vulnerabilities and contribute to a more secure and accessible online environment.

I am primarily advised by [Prof. Cecilia Testart](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ctestart8/). I am also advised by [Prof. Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/) and [Romain Fontugne](https://www.iijlab.net/en/members/romain.html).

Before starting my PhD, I used to create algo-trading strategies, develop low latency trading systems and Blockchain simulators. I graduated with a major in *Mathematics and Computing* from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2020.

Lately I have been able to travel a bit and I photograph landscapes. Browse my creative work
